## project 

- Name: Shopping Cart API
- Application Implementation Pattern:  spring-boot-mvc-jpa-postgresql
- Detailed Description:  

    The Shopping Cart API is a Spring Boot application that provides a complete backend service for managing shopping cart operations in an e-commerce environment. It follows the MVC architecture and leverages JPA for persistence with PostgreSQL as the database engine. The API enables secure, transactional operations including creating and managing shopping carts, adding or removing items, applying discounts, and calculating totals. Designed with RESTful principles, it exposes standardized endpoints that can be integrated with frontend clients, payment services, and downstream order-processing systems. The implementation emphasizes modularity, maintainability, and enterprise-grade reliability, with built-in support for validation, error handling, and extensibility to support new features such as promotions, multi-currency pricing, or customer-specific rules.
